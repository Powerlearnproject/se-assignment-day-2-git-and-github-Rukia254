## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
version control is a system that tracks every modification,allow one to revisit the previous version of one's project,compare differences and collaborate with others. the key concepts are repository,commit,branch,merge,conflict,clone and push/pull.gitHub is popular tool for managing version of code because it provides a platform for developers to collaborate on projects from anywhere in the world,easy to manage and outomate workflows,acts as central hub for learmig,maintain the security and integrity of the project and integration making easier to manage version of codes. version control help in maintaining project inegrity by maintaining history of all changes made to a project,automatic back up of project,identifies and resolve conflict when multiple people work on the same codebase.

## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?

vi)initialize the repository by either adding a README file,add a .gitignore file or choose a license

## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?

## Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?

## Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.

## Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?
